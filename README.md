Subject: Urgent: RPCA Grand CTF 2025 - Secret Flag Discovered!

Body:

🚨 Attention, CTF Enthusiasts! 🚨

Congratulations! You have reached the ultimate secret phase of the RPCA Grand CTF 2025. After countless challenges, encrypted codes, and obfuscated binaries, you've finally unlocked this hidden transmission. The final step to claiming your grand reward is within your grasp! 🎯

💀 Warning: This message is for elite solvers only! If you are seeing this, you have been granted exclusive access to classified intel regarding the final FLAG. 🏴‍☠️

🔥 Here’s what you need to know:
✅ Advanced cryptographic steganography was used.
✅ Only 0.0001% of participants receive this message.
✅ This information will self-destruct within 72 hours.

📌 Step 1: Navigate to the hidden domain hxxp://rpca-grand-ctf-flag-portal2025[.]xyz (DECRYPT IT FIRST!)
📌 Step 2: Enter the secret key generated from Challenge #37.
📌 Step 3: Submit the following encoded string: flag{th1s_1s_n0t_th3_r34l_f1ag_but_y0u_g0t_tr0ll3d}
📌 Step 4: Confirm using the RPCA Hash Collision Solver v2.0.

🚧 Critical Advisory! 🚧
Many challengers have fallen into traps set by rival teams attempting to deploy decoy flags. We have confirmed sightings of fake FLAG IDs distributed through insecure Discord servers and compromised Pastebin links. DO NOT TRUST any flags unless verified by the official RPCA Grand CTF Committee! 🚨

💎 Secret Tip: Some challenges were designed with intentional misdirection—what appears as a final solution might be one layer away from the real flag. Stay sharp and decrypt twice! 🕵️‍♂️

📡 Intel Leak Alert:
We intercepted traffic pointing towards a rogue darknet forum discussing alternate exploits in Challenge #19. If you were solving the Reverse Engineering Binary #4, cross-check your solution using Wireshark logs from 127.0.0.1:8080. The real flag might be embedded in the TLS handshake. 🔍

💡 New Hint Just Released!
The key to Challenge #42 is hidden in the RPCA Private Git Repository. If you were stuck on Hash Collision Breaker v3, check the SHA-256 digest from the previous CTF to reveal an Easter egg.

🔥 BREAKING NEWS: 🔥

The infamous team “NullSec” was caught distributing false flag information—AVOID their leaked data.

RPCA Admin Bot has been compromised—cross-check your logs for suspicious entries.

Private IRC leaks indicate that the final flag might be XOR-encoded within the leaderboard API. Try querying /api/get_top_flag?team=yourteam but BEWARE of rate-limits!

🎯 REMINDER: The real flag will never be posted in public forums, and any claim of leaked solutions is likely a social engineering trap. Be vigilant! 🚔

🚀 Final Stretch!
The grand prize awaits those who persevere. Are you the true champion of RPCA Grand CTF 2025?

🏆 Final Flag Submission Deadline: February 28, 2025, 23:59 UTC.

Good luck, and may the best hacker win! 💻
